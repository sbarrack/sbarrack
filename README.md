Yo, I'm a software engineer 👋 Web development is *clearly* my passion and *totally* not my day job 😆 My coworkers know me as the local CSS guy ✨ At home, __I use Linux btw__ 😎 and I frankenstein video game controllers together with Arduinos 🎮 I'm always learning more about programming 📚 Hit me up if you want to talk about ricing desktops or if you just want to play skribbl.io 🖌️
